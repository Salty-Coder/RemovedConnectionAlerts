# RemovedConnectionAlerts

Keep track of your friends and servers on [BetterDiscord](https://betterdiscord.app/plugin/RemovedConnectionAlerts), and get notified if you get unfriended or kicked from a server.

Note: This plugin only tracks removals from when it's installed. It cannot show you your history from before installation.

When you use this plugin, it's a good idea to regularly keep backups of your history files in case something happens to it.

Your history files can be found next to the plugin itself. They are named `RemovedConnectionAlerts_{your Discord user ID number here}.config.json`.

## Credits

Inspired by [Metalloriff](https://github.com/Metalloriff) and their [GuildAndFriendRemovalAlerts](https://github.com/Metalloriff/BetterDiscordPlugins/tree/master/GuildAndFriendRemovalAlerts). Code written in this project is independent and unrelated. Mostly a passion project and coding exercise.

Thank you [programmer2514](https://github.com/programmer2514) and their [CollapsibleUI](https://github.com/programmer2514/BetterDiscord-CollapsibleUI) for helping me out with UI things as well!

## Usage

Access your history by clicking this button, next to your inbox icon:

The UI will appear like below, with your recent removals (within the last 24 hours) being at the top, and the rest at the bottom of the window.

This UI will also automatically appear when a removal is detected.

Updating your cache will manually check your friends and servers lists for updates:
